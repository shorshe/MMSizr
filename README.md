MMSizr
======

osx shell script to scale images down to 2 million pixels according to Apple ibookstore spec. This should help to create ePubs according to the recommended specs by Apple:

"Your book, vendor ID:NNN, could not be delivered. The following images are larger than two million pixels and must be resized"

There is also an OSX App created with Platypus.

The script is very rough at the moment.

The ideal future version of this script should unpack an epub, find the image folder resize any big images with the bundeled convert-function (imagemagick) an repack again.

If you like the App, please consider a flattr-klick on this page: http://suntoucher.de/mmsizr-a-scriptapp-to-resize-images-to-2-million-pixels/
